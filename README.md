# Pratyay — An Intelligent Brand Governance Platform

> **Enterprise Brand Compliance, Terminology Enforcement & Claim Verification Portal**  
> Built for the CodeStar Hackathon.

---

## 1. Overview

**Pratyay** is an AI-assisted brand governance platform that checks draft marketing content against an organization's approved brand guidelines, terminology, factual claims, and available evidence.

### Core Principle
> *"Explain the issue, show the evidence where available, suggest a correction, and keep final approval with a human."*

The application is architected as a professional B2B SaaS platform rather than a generic conversational chatbot. Automated checks assist the review process; they do not independently authorize publication.

  - Strongly typed `Finding`, `FindingType`, `FindingSeverity`, `FindingEvidenceStatus`, and `FindingStatus` in `src/types/index.ts`.

  - Responsive two-column desktop / stacked mobile layout.
  - Original Submitted Text pane: preserved verbatim and read-only, rendering accessible semantic `<mark>` highlights with wavy/dashed underlines and keyboard navigation (`role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`).
  - Bi-directional selection: clicking a highlighted span scrolls and focuses the finding card; clicking a finding focuses the text span.
  - Working Revision Draft pane: separate editable textarea where suggested revisions are previewed and applied safely without mutating original text.
- [x] **State Management & Persistence**:
  - `FindingContext` with custom hook `useFindings`.
  - Decisions and revision drafts synchronized to `localStorage` (`pratyay_finding_decisions_v1` and `pratyay_working_drafts_v1`).

  - `highlight-text-ranges`: semantic `<mark>` elements with non-color indicators (wavy underlines, badges) for accessible text highlighting.

### Phase 5: Human Review Workflow, Approval Controls, and Audit History (Completed)
- [x] **Review Lifecycle & Transition Integrity**:
  - Supported lifecycle: `Draft` → `In Review` → `Needs Changes` → `Approved`.
  - Content submitted for review transitions to `In Review`.
  - Consequential reviewer action: "Request Changes" requires a mandatory reason, attaches comments to review, and logs `changes_requested`.
  - Resubmission workflow: creator can submit working revision as a new version snapshot (`v2.0`), updating active review draft while permanently preserving original submitted text.
  - Human review approval: requires explicit confirmation acknowledgment checkbox confirming editorial review. Never approves automatically.
- [x] **Human Reviewer Sign-Off Modal (`ReviewSignOffModal.tsx`)**:
  - Dialog modal for consequential editorial decisions (`Approve`, `Request Changes`, `Resubmit Revision`).
  - Labeled demo reviewer identities: Editorial Reviewer (Demo), Compliance Officer (Demo), Technical Specialist (Demo).
  - Explicit confirmation guard prevents accidental approval without reviewer acknowledgment.
  - Reviewer decision callouts prominently displayed on the review details page.

  - Export functionality: 1-click "Export JSON Log" for compliance records.
  - Audit disclosure: transparent notice clarifying client-side localStorage demo persistence.
- [x] **State Management & Cross-App Synchronization**:
  - `AuditContext` with custom hook `useAudit`, persisted in `localStorage` (`pratyay_audit_events_v1`).
  - Overview dashboard (`/`) activity feed dynamically linked to live audit events.
  - Synchronization across Overview, Content Reviews, Review Details, and Audit Log.
- [x] **Modern Web Guidance Compliance**:
  - `dialog`: accessible modal dialog with focus management, `Escape` key dismiss, and confirmation guards against accidental discard.
